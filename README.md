# PalindromeNumber
The LeetCode [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) problem.

> Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
>
> An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.
> - Example 1:

>   Input: x = 121
    > 
>   
>   Output: true
> 
>
> - Example 2:
> 
>   Input: x = -121

>   Output: false
     
>   Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
>
> 
> - Example 3:

>   Input: x = 10
     
>   Output: false
>  
>   Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
> 
> - Example 4:
>
>   Input: x = -101
>
>   Output: false
>
>Constraints:
>
>-231 <= x <= 231 - 1


> Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
> You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
>
> You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
